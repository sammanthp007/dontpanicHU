## What is a Panic Attack?
A panic attack is a severe attack of anxiety and fear which occurs suddenly, often without warning, and for no apparent reason.
In addition to the anxiety, various other symptoms may also occur during a panic attack. These include one or more of the following:

* A 'thumping heart' (palpitations).
* Sweating and trembling.
* Dry mouth.
* Hot flushes or chills.
* Feeling short of breath, sometimes with choking sensations.
* Chest pains.
* Feeling sick (nauseated), dizzy, or faint.
* Fear of dying or going crazy.
* Numbness, or pins and needles.
* Feelings of unreality, or being detached from yourself.

The physical symptoms that occur with panic attacks do not mean there is a physical problem with the heart, chest, etc. The symptoms mainly occur because of an overdrive of nervous impulses from the brain to various parts of the body during a panic attack. This overdrive of nervous impulses can lead to the body producing hormones which include adrenaline (epinephrine). This is sometimes referred to as a 'fight or flight' response. This kind of reaction is normal in people when we feel we are in danger. During a panic attack the body can react in the same way.

### During a panic attack you tend to over-breathe (hyperventilate). 
If you over-breathe you blow out too much carbon dioxide, which changes the acidity in the blood. This can then cause more symptoms (such as confusion and cramps) and make a 'thumping heart', dizziness and pins and needles worse. This can make the attack seem even more frightening and make you over-breathe even more, and so on. Over-breathing may make you feel very light-headed and even lose consciouness for a brief period. However, losing consciouness when over-breathing is very uncommon.

### A panic attack usually lasts 5-10 minutes; however, sometimes panic attacks come in waves for up to two hours.

## Hyperventilation or Breathing Fast
### In adult humans at rest, any respiratory rate between 12 and 20 breaths per minute is normal and tachypnea is indicated by a rate greater than 20 breaths per minute.


## Treatment for panic attacks and panic disorder
Panic attacks and panic disorder are treatable conditions. They can usually be treated successfully with self-help strategies or a series of therapy sessions.
* Calling the emergency contact

* Pursed Breathing
        The steps to do pursed lip breathing are:

        * Relax the muscles in your neck and shoulders.
        * Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet on the floor.
        * Inhale slowly through your nose for 2 counts.
        * Feel your belly get larger as you breathe in.
        * Pucker your lips, as if you were going to whistle or blow out a candle.
        * Exhale slowly through your lips for 4 or more counts.

* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
        Cognitive behavioral therapy is generally viewed as the most effective form of treatment for panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the thinking patterns and behaviors that are sustaining or triggering the panic attacks. It helps you look at your fears in a more realistic light.
        For example, if you had a panic attack while driving, what is the worst thing that would really happen? While you might have to pull over to the side of the road, you are not likely to crash your car or have a heart attack. Once you learn that nothing truly disastrous is going to happen, the experience of panic becomes less terrifying.

* Exposure therapy for panic attacks and panic disorder
        In exposure therapy for panic disorder, you are exposed to the physical sensations of panic in a safe and controlled environment, giving you the opportunity to learn healthier ways of coping. You may be asked to hyperventilate, shake your head from side to side, or hold your breath. These different exercises cause sensations similar to the symptoms of panic. With each exposure, you become less afraid of these internal bodily sensations and feel a greater sense of control over your panic.

        If you have agoraphobia, exposure to the situations you fear and avoid is also included in treatment. As in exposure therapy for specific phobias, you face the feared situation until the panic begins to go away. Through this experience, you learn that the situation isnâ€™t harmful and that you have control over your emotions.
